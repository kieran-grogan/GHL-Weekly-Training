- M03: Tag Added → Notify + Task (tags as events)
- M04: Form Submitted → Tag + Field Update + Task + Notify (intake)
- M05: Field Updates as Data Modeling (prep for branching)

## Phase 2 — Branching + Guardrails (M06–M10)
- M06: If/Else guardrail: phone exists → SMS else Email
- M07: If/Else segmentation: lead_source Facebook vs Google
- M08: Multi-branch segmentation: FB vs Google vs Other
- M09: Do-not-contact guardrail: stop path
- M10: Consent gating for SMS with fallback path

## Phase 3 — Sequences + Timing (M11–M15)
- M11: Timed sequence: Email → Wait → Follow-up
- M12: No-response follow-up using responded tag
- M13: Response Handler workflow + stopping nurture (multi-workflow)
- M14: Appointment Scheduled → confirm + stop nurture
- M15: Appointment reminders + cancel guardrail (advanced waits)

## Phase 4 — Pipeline + Ops (M16–M18)
- M16: Pipeline stage change → internal task + notify
- M17: Stage “Won” → onboarding steps + ops handoff
- M18: Stale lead reactivation (wait + branch)

## Phase 5 — Systems + Micro-workflows (M19–M23)
- M19: Router workflow: intake → route tags + missing info path
- M20: Micro-workflow: FB nurture flow (tag-triggered)
- M21: Micro-workflow: General nurture flow (tag-triggered)

Each module introduces ONE main new difficulty dimension:
- new node type OR new pattern OR new architecture concept
