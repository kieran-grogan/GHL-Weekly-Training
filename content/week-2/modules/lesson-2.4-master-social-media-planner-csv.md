# Lesson 2.4 — Master Social Planner (Bulk Scheduling via CSV + QA)

## Outcome
You can bulk schedule content reliably, validate imports, and troubleshoot CSV issues without guesswork.

## Resource
Use the included CSV sample:
`week-2/resources/social-media-posting_basic-sample.csv`

## Step‑by‑Step (45–60 min)
1) Open **Social Planner → Bulk import / CSV import** (exact label varies by account).
2) Download the platform’s CSV template (if available) and compare to our sample.
3) Import the sample CSV.
4) Validate:
   - posts appear on correct dates
   - correct channels/accounts
   - media/links are present
5) Edit at least 1 imported post and save.
6) Document the required CSV columns and “gotchas”:
   - required headers
   - date/time format
   - time zone behavior
   - media URL rules (if any)

## CSV Troubleshooting Checklist
- Column headers match exactly (case and spacing can matter).
- Date format matches system expectation.
- Time format is valid for the location time zone.
- Media references are valid/accessible.
- Channel/account names are correct.

## Practical Assignment
- Successfully import the CSV sample.
- Show proof that at least 5 posts are scheduled.
- Create a **short SOP note**: “How we bulk schedule posts (CSV)”.
