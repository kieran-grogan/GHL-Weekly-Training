# Lesson 2.3 — Social Media Planner Deep Dive (Setup + Daily Use)

## Outcome
You can run Social Planner like an operator: connected accounts, correct time zone, consistent scheduling, and quality control.

## What Social Planner is (and isn’t)
- It is **the scheduling and execution layer** for consistent content.
- It is not “set it and forget it” — you still QA connections and failed posts.

## Step‑by‑Step: Setup & Verification (30–45 min)
1) Go to **Marketing → Social Planner**
2) Confirm **connected accounts**:
   - which channels are available (FB/IG/LinkedIn/etc.)
   - validate you’re connecting the correct brand pages
3) Confirm **time zone** in Business Profile (Settings → Business Profile)
4) Create 2 manual posts:
   - one image post
   - one text-only post
   - schedule on different days/times
5) Confirm:
   - posts appear on the calendar/queue
   - media is attached and preview looks right
6) Edit a scheduled post:
   - update copy
   - re-save
7) Document any failure:
   - “what failed”
   - “what you tried”
   - “who you escalated to (if needed)”

## Failure Modes & Troubleshooting
- **Wrong time zone** → posts publish at wrong times.
- **Disconnected accounts** → publishing fails silently or errors.
- **Media format unsupported** → image/video fails.
- **Permissions** on the social page → connection exists but cannot publish.

## Practical Assignment
- Schedule 3 manual posts in Social Planner.
- Submit Loom showing:
  - connected accounts
  - queue/calendar
  - one edit + save
