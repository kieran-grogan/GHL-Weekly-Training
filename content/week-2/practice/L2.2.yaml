    description: |
      Create a concise 1-page playbook (markdown or text format) that documents how StrategixAI operates using GHL. 
      The playbook must include these 6 sections:
      
      1. What we sell (1 paragraph)
         - Describe StrategixAI's core service offering
      
      2. How leads enter
         - Explain the lead entry points and initial contact process
      
      3. How comms are handled (ownership + escalation)
         - Document conversation ownership rules
         - Explain escalation path: Diana → Brian → Hunter
         - Note billing escalations go to Mark
      
      4. How status is tracked (pipelines/tasks)
         - Identify which pipelines track client status
         - Explain how tasks are used for operations
         - Note where "truth lives" for client status
      
      5. How we automate (workflows/fields/values)
         - Describe key automation workflows
         - Explain how custom fields and values power automation
         - Identify critical automation touchpoints
      
      6. How support works post-handoff
         - Explain the support process after client onboarding
         - Document support ticket workflow
         - Note escalation points for support issues
      
      **Pass Criteria:**
      - Explains escalation path clearly (Diana → Brian → Hunter; Billing → Mark)
      - Identifies at least 3 "truth lives here" examples (e.g., "Pipeline stage is the source of truth for client status")
      - All 6 sections are present and complete
