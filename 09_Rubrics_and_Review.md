# 09 — Rubrics and Review (Teach-back + Reviewer)

## Teach-back rubric (universal checklist)
A passing teach-back includes:
1) Trigger: what starts the workflow
2) Sequence: what happens next (in order)
3) Branching: what conditions decide paths (if present)
4) Timing: what waits exist and why (if present)
5) Outcomes: what state changes/messages happen
6) Guardrails/stop rules: how it avoids wrong sends/spam (if present)
7) Debug plan: how they would confirm it works (simulation/logs)

## Scoring (MVP)
- Pass/Fail checklist
- Minimum requirement: must cover items 1, 2, and 5
- For branching modules: must include item 3
- For timing modules: must include item 4

## Reviewer workflow (optional)
- Reviewer sees submission with:
  - learner graph snapshot
  - validation result
  - teach-back text
- Reviewer can mark:
  - Pass
  - Needs revision (one revision allowed)
- Co-pilot can propose feedback prompts (not final authority)

## Anti-cheat note
The goal is mastery; keep solution reveal gated and logged.
