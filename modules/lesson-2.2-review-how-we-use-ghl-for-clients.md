# Lesson 2.2 — Review How We Use GHL for Clients (StrategixAI Playbook)

## Outcome
You understand the StrategixAI “system model” inside GHL: how leads enter, how we communicate, how we automate, how we deliver builds, and how we support after handoff.

## The StrategixAI model (simple but strict)
### 1) Acquire / Capture
- Lead enters (form, inbound call, ads, import, referral)
- Contact is created + tagged

### 2) Communicate
- Conversations is the unified inbox (SMS/email/social)
- Ownership and response SLA are enforced

### 3) Qualify / Track
- Pipelines represent stages (sales + onboarding + support)
- Opportunities are the cards that move

### 4) Automate
- Workflows drive follow‑up, reminders, internal notifications, routing
- Custom Fields/Values store truth + feed templates/logic

### 5) Deliver
- For builds: we translate scope into build plan, then build in GHL (and sometimes via automated CSV tools)
- QA checklists ensure consistency

### 6) Support (post-handoff)
- Intake → triage → escalation → resolution
- SOPs + ticket-style tracking prevent chaos

## What you must be able to explain (to leadership)
- Where do requests come in?
- Who owns the first response?
- How do we decide escalation to Brian vs Hunter?
- Where do we track status: pipeline stage, task, and internal notes?
- What is “done” for a client request?

## Practical Assignment
Write a 1-page summary (or Loom) answering:
1) What modules do we use daily?
2) What is our escalation path?
3) What is “truth” in our system (where does the status live)?
4) What breaks the system fastest?

## Quiz (10)
1) What is the “front door” for inbound client requests?
2) What are pipelines used for?
3) Why do we use workflows?
4) What should live in a custom field (vs a note)?
5) What are Custom Values used for?
6) When do we escalate to Hunter?
7) What’s the risk of handling work “in Slack” only?
8) What is the purpose of SOPs?
9) What does “duplicate before edit” protect us from?
10) Define “truth” in our system.
