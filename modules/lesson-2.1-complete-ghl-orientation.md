# Lesson 2.1 — Complete GHL Orientation (Dashboard, Contacts, Conversations)

## Outcome
You can confidently navigate the GHL UI and locate the “operational core” of StrategixAI inside any sub‑account.

## What matters most (StrategixAI)
- **Contacts** = who the person is
- **Conversations** = what’s being said (front door)
- **Workflows** = how we automate outcomes
- **Social Planner** = how we execute content consistently
- **Settings** = where most issues hide (permissions, phone/email, time zone, custom fields/values)

## Step‑by‑Step (20–30 min)
1) Confirm **location/sub‑account** (top-left). Say it out loud before making changes.
2) Open and identify:
   - Dashboard
   - Contacts
   - Conversations
   - Automation → Workflows
   - Marketing → Social Planner
   - Settings
3) In **Settings**, locate:
   - Business Profile (time zone matters)
   - My Staff / Team (permissions)
   - Custom Fields
   - Custom Values
   - Phone numbers / Email services (if visible)
4) Open **Contacts**:
   - search a contact
   - open the contact detail
   - locate tags, timeline, and contact fields
5) Open **Conversations**:
   - locate assigned/unassigned filters
   - open a thread
   - add an internal note (no sending)
6) Open **Workflows**:
   - locate folders, search bar, and execution logs

## Failure Modes
- Working in the wrong location.
- Missing permissions and assuming “GHL is broken.”
- Changing live workflows without duplicating.

## Practical Assignment
Record a 60–90 second Loom:
- show correct location
- show where Contacts/Conversations/Workflows/Social Planner live
- show where Business Profile time zone is

## Quiz (10)
1) What is the first thing you verify before any action?
2) Where do you check location time zone?
3) Where do workflows live?
4) Where do you find unassigned conversations?
5) What’s the safest way to “fix” a workflow?
6) What causes “missing” menu items most often?
7) What is the “front door” module at Strategix?
8) Where do you find Custom Fields?
9) Where do you find Custom Values?
10) What must every change include (Strategix standard)?
