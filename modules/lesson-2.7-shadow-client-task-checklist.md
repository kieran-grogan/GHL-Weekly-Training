# Lesson 2.7 — Shadow Kieran/Hunter on a Client Task (and Convert it into a Repeatable SOP)

## Outcome
You can shadow a real client action, capture what happened, and turn it into a repeatable SOP entry.

## Shadowing Rules
- You do not “drive” unless asked.
- You take notes on:
  - where in GHL the work happened
  - what inputs were required
  - what steps were taken
  - what could break
  - how to test success

## Shadow Checklist (during)
Capture:
1) Client name + objective
2) Module(s) used (Contacts/Conversations/Workflows/Sites/etc.)
3) Pre-checks (permissions, time zone, existing assets)
4) Actions taken (step-by-step)
5) Testing method (how we proved it worked)
6) Escalation points (when it required Hunter)

## Debrief Checklist (after)
Submit:
- A 1-page debrief:
  - Summary
  - Steps
  - Failure modes
  - QA checklist
  - “Next time we should…”
- Convert it into SOP format (use the SOP Template headings)

## Practical Assignment
Shadow one client task and submit:
- Loom or written debrief
- SOP draft (v0.1)

## Quiz (10)
1) Why is shadowing valuable?
2) What must every SOP include?
3) What’s the fastest way to create future leverage from a task?
4) What are “failure modes” and why list them?
5) What is a QA checklist?
6) When do you escalate to Hunter?
7) What is the difference between “steps” and “rules”?
8) What is the minimum acceptable debrief?
9) What should you capture about testing?
10) How do you store the SOP so the team can use it?
