# 00 — PRD: StrategixAI GHL Operations Training (Week 2)
**Date:** January 2026

## 1) Problem
VAs and operations staff often know "how" to click buttons in GHL, but lack the discipline and diagnostic skills to:
- Confirm they are in the correct sub-account before acting.
- Maintain high data hygiene (tagging, naming conventions).
- Efficiently manage the Conversations inbox and Opportunities pipeline.
- Proactively handle tasks and social planning without constant oversight.

## 2) Goal
Train StrategixAI staff to be elite GHL Operators who follow standards, prevent errors, and maintain a "single source of truth" in the CRM.

After completion, learners can:
1) Navigate any GHL sub-account with speed and precision.
2) Perform high-standard data hygiene on contact records.
3) Manage multi-channel conversations without missing leads.
4) Move opportunities through pipelines following company SOPs.
5) Execute tasks using the internal execution engine.
6) Schedule and manage social media content using the Social Planner.

## 3) Product
A custom training application with:
- Progressive lessons focused on Week 2 Operational outcomes.
- Integrated standard rubrics and "StrategixAI Standards."
- Video submission requirements (Loom-based) for practical proof.
- Teach-back requirement for conceptual mastery.
- AI mentor for coaching on operations and data hygiene.

## 4) Course loop (every lesson)
1) **Learn** (outcome, vocabulary, StrategixAI standards).
2) **Step-by-Step** walkthrough (15-minute execution).
3) **Practical Assignment** (Loom recording or screenshot proof).
4) **Quiz** (Self-assessment of core concepts).
5) **Teach-back** (Explain the "why" and "how" to a peer).
