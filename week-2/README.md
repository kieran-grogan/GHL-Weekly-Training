## Week 2 Outcomes (what “done” looks like)

By Friday teach‑back, Brian + Diana can demonstrate:

### A) GHL navigation and operating confidence
- Confirm correct location/sub‑account before acting.
- Find and operate **Dashboard, Contacts, Conversations, Automations/Workflows, Social Planner, Settings**.

### B) Social Planner competence (manual + bulk)
- Create, schedule, edit, and QA posts.
- Bulk import posts via CSV and validate scheduling + media.

### C) Support process is real (not theoretical)
- A working support intake path exists: **intake → triage → assignment → escalation → resolution → follow‑up**.
- Everyone knows “who owns what” and how to escalate.

### D) Workflow replication skill
- Duplicate an existing workflow safely and fix common logic errors (date/wait/filter mistakes).
- Test enrollment and confirm results.

### E) Shadowing becomes leverage
- They can shadow a live client task and produce a clean debrief + SOP entry.

## Operating Standards (StrategixAI)

1) **Right location or stop.** Confirm you’re in the correct sub‑account/location before changes.
2) **Duplicate before edit.** Never “fix” a workflow live without duplicating first.
3) **Owner + next step.** Every item ends with: who owns next + what’s next + when.
4) **Escalation path:** Diana → Brian → Hunter (technical). Billing/finance routes to Mark.
